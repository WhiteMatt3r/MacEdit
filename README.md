# MacEdit
THIS PROJECT IS NOT COMPLETED, IT'S JUST HERE AS A BACK-UP

This Python utility will allow you to edit MAC addresses for all of your interfaces. 

It will also generate a bash script and service to automatically randomize your MAC address on boot. (Feature not yet added)

Inline usage:

./mac.py -inline -i INTERFACE -h/-r/-v/-m

-inline -i INTERFACE must come before the options
