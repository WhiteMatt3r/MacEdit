# MacEdit
THIS PROJECT IS NOT COMPLETED, IT'S JUST HERE AS A BACK-UP
This Python utility will allow you to edit MAC addresses for all of your interfaces. 

It will also generate a bash script and service to automatically randomize your MAC address on boot. (Feature not yet added)

There will be on-the-fly options added.
